# <Homework-Code-Refactor>
## Description
This homework assignment serves as a mock on-the-job ticket. We were given starter code that needed fixes and refactoring.
  
The original code needed to be refactored to better adhere to accesibility best practices in order to be more readable for assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards, as well as for search engines like Google crawlers in order to improve rankings on search results.
  
- **What was your motivation?**
In this mock role at a marketing agency, our motivation was to deliver results to a client. 
  
- **Why did you build this project?**
We built this project to improve readability and accesibiltiy for screen readers and SEO rankings.

- **What problem does it solve?**
The updates made to the original code solve issues like missing page title, descriptive semantic HTML elements, alt text, and low contrast. These problems were addressed to improve the page's accesibility score.

- **What did you learn?**
We learned the importance of the practice of using an accesibility checklist on web pages, the value of readable metadata for users and including keywords for SEO, creating cleaner code and how a typical code refactoring ticket might look like in the real world.
